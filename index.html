      <h1> YOU ARE MY SPECIALZ </h1>
      <p> Sorry, Amanai. I'm not even angry over you right now. I bear no grudge against anyone. <br> <br>
         It's just that the world feels so, so wonderful right now. Throughout Heaven and Earth, I alone am the honored one <br> 
         The merit of having a technique that's passed down for generations is having a user's manual. <br> <br>
         The demerit is that information about the technique is easily leaked. You were a member of the Zen'in clan, weren't you? <br>
         That's why you know so much about the Limitless technique. However, even in the Gojo clan, only a scant few know about this. <br> <br>
         Take the amplified and the reversal, then smash together those two different expressions of infinity to create and push out imaginary mass. <br> <br>
